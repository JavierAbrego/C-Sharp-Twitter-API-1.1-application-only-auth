The library uses Application-only authentication which offers applications the ability to issue authenticated requests on behalf of the application itself (as opposed to on behalf of a specific user). Twitter's implementation is based on the Client Credentials Grant flow of the OAuth 2 specification.\r\nWith Application-only authentication you don't have the context of an authenticated user and this means that any request to API for endpoints that require user context, such as posting tweets, will not work. However, the set of endpoints that will still be available can have a higher rate limit.\r\n\r\nYour app will be able to, for example:\r\n\r\nPull user timelines;\r\nAccess friends and followers of any account;\r\nAccess lists resources;\r\nSearch in tweets;\r\nRetrieve any user information;\r\nAnd it won't be able to:\r\n\r\nPost tweets or other resources;\r\nConnect in Streaming endpoints;\r\nSearch for users;\r\nUse any geo endpoint;\r\nAccess DMs or account credentials;\r\n\r\nrefer to https://dev.twitter.com/docs/auth/application-only-auth for more information\r\n\r\n###Auth Flow\r\n\r\nThe application-only auth flow follows these steps:\r\n\r\nAn application encodes its consumer key and secret into a specially encoded set of credentials.\r\nAn application makes a request to the POST oauth2/token endpoint to exchange these credentials for a bearer token.\r\nWhen accessing the REST API, the application uses the bearer token to authenticate.\r\n\r\n## 2. Installation\r\n\r\nThe library need NewtonSoft JSON library, you just need to add in references the 2 libraries (.dll) from the bin folder to your project.\r\n\r\nYou will need too to get the credentials from the twitter developer website and create an application. See https://apps.twitter.com/ for more information.\r\n\r\n## 3. Usage\r\n```\r\n[...]\r\n\r\nusing TwiitterApi;\r\n\r\n[...]\r\n\r\n\r\nAPIv1_1 twitter = new APIv1_1();\r\n\r\nString api_secret = \"yourapisecrethere\"; //set your api secret\r\n\r\nString api_key = \"yourapikeyhere\"; //set you api key\r\n\r\n\r\ntwitter.setApiCredentials(api_secret, api_key);\r\n\r\nstring url = String.Format(\"https://api.twitter.com/1.1/users/show.json?screen_name={0}\", screenName);\r\n\r\nString response = twitter.getTwitterDataBearerRequest(url);\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n## 4. Credits\r\nThis plugin was  entirely created by [Javier Abrego].\r\n\r\n\r\n## 5. CHANGELOG\r\n\r\n1.0: initial version supporting generic calls to Twitter API and retrieve of User information\r\n\r\n## 6. Contribute\r\n\r\nIf you see an area for improvement, or have an idea for a new feature then we'd love to have your help!\r\nGitHub repo:\r\n```\r\nhttps://github.com/JavierAbrego/C-Sharp-Twitter-API-1.1-application-only-auth/\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n## 7.
